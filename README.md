# placekbot
A Discord bot I made ages ago and forgot completely how it works. I'm uploading it here so I don't lose it. 

Uses the discord.py rewrite, asyncio and praw. 

You will need to set up a reddit application, like here: https://redditclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth/ and input the client ID and secret at the top. You'll also need to follow step 2-4 of this tutorial https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/ to get a authorization token and invite link for the bot. Auth token goes at the very bottom, client.run('here')

$reddit (subreddit) will fetch a random image from the subreddit mentioned. That's literally it, why did i make this. Please dont bully my crap code I have no idea what I'm doing.
